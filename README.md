Tindog is a website based on the app Tinder, except this time it's for dogs!

About Tindog
Tindog is the home page of a website that displays details such as the description of the website in the heading, download button, feedback section, pricing section for plans and subscriptions, call to action, and a footer for add social media.

Tools Used
The main tools used to make Tindog are HTML, Bootstrap for spacing and alignment, and also to make the website mobile friendly.CSS was used for design, and GSAP for animation in the beginning when you first open the page. I also practiced UI desgin in making this website.
